# Microservices Suite 🦧

## Overview

Welcome to the 📦 [Microservices](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1Noc_6WVe0CmzynnuURexm7MCv75OUAuQ/view?usp=drive_link) Suite project! This suite is a collection of Node.js microservices built using the 🦧 [mono-repo]() strategy and leveraging the [yarn workspaces](https://classic.yarnpkg.com/lang/en/docs/workspaces/) concept. Each microservice runs in its isolated Docker `container`, and `Kubernetes` orchestrates the deployment, providing scalability and efficiency.
To easily work with a `@microservices-suite monorepo` you need to install [Suite CLI](https://www.npmjs.com/package/@microservices-suite/cli). With `Suite` you can easily scaffold,manage and automate your monorepo in development, CI as well as production. Check the installation guidelines in the `README.md` section of the `.suite-cli` root.

## Monorepo strategy benefits for microservices:

- **Enforce [DRY](https://japhethobala.com/posts/technical/single-responsibility/) Principles:**
  - [@Japheth Obala](https://github.com/jobala) the Prophet 😎 has done a sleek job demystifying [👉SOLID & best practice here](https://japhethobala.com/).
  - Collocating code encourages code sharing.
  - Reduce duplication 👉[read about SOLID here](https://japhethobala.com/)
  - Save time by building on existing boilerplate or reusable functionality.

- **Collaboration:** 
  - Working within the same repository facilitates learning from peers.
  - Enables the adoption of good coding practices and the avoidance of bad ones.

- **Centralized Development Chores:** 
  - Manage common files like `.gitignore` centrally from the root directory
  - Reduce unnecessary repetitions in the codebase.

- **Easily Integrate Development Automation:** 
  - Task runner configurations and docker-compose can be managed from the root directory.
  - simplify the automation of repetitive workflows.

- **Code Sharing Anywhere:** 
  - Publish and import organization-scoped libraries from the npm registry with 
```bash
    yarn release 
    yarn add <@microservices-suite/foo>
    yarn workspace @microservices-suite/<workspace-name> add  @microservices-suite/<library> 
```
  - Using `Suite CLI` you could achieve the results with the following commands
```bash
    suite release 
    suite add <@microservices-suite/foo>
    suite -W <workspace-name> add  @microservices-suite/<library> 
```

- **Easily Containerize and Scale:** 
  - Decouple every microservice to scale individually. 
  - Leverage the [no-hoist yarn workspace](https://classic.yarnpkg.com/blog/2018/02/15/nohoist/) feature and custom scripts to enable efficient packaging of microservices into isolated containers.

## Technologies Used

- **Yarn Workspaces:** 
  - Simplifies managing multiple packages within a single repository.
  - Encourage code sharing & reduce duplication
  - Make it easier to handle dependencies and scripts.
  
- **Docker Containers:** 
  - Provides lightweight, portable, and self-sufficient containers for packaging and deploying microservices.

### **Alpine** Images

- Alpine images are very minimalistic Linux minidistros that cost you only `~5MB` of real estate. That is why they are used inside your favourite `smart watch ⌚️`. 
- One objective of this project is to `optimize image builds for Continuous Integration (CI)` and `production` environments through the utilization of the slimmest possible images so that you dont bloat ⚠️ your machine in dev and we have a lean server in prod.

#### Key Strategies:

- **Multi-Stage Builds:** 
  - We employ simple Docker constructs like `multi-stage builds` to optimize our image size.

- **Hoisting and Symlinking:**
  - While these practices promote the `DRY` (Don't Repeat Yourself) principle, they pose a threat to our objective of achieving minimized images. To mitigate this, we leverage `no-hoisting and symlinked libraries`
  - selectively copying only the `node_modules` generated by `non-hoisted workspaces`. 
  - These are optimized to consume less disk space, ensuring that only the essential shared libraries required by a specific service are included, thereby maintaining the slim profile of our images.
  - The service itself will build her core node modules normally inside the dockerfile from her `package.json` 

### Docker & Node Best Practices

### Kubernetes (k8s)

- Kubernetes offers automated deployment, scaling, and management of containerized applications, ensuring reliability and scalability.

# Getting Started

Welcome to our project! To ensure a smooth setup and development experience, ensure you have the following tools installed on your machine:


- **Docker:** 
  - For containerization and managing containerized applications.  
  - 👉 [Install docker here](https://docs.docker.com/engine/install/).
  - We love 💚 [alpine images](https://alpinelinux.org/) <small,simple,secure>. 
  - You can read about the specific flavor [here](https://github.com/nodejs/docker-node/blob/main/README.md#how-to-use-this-image)
- **Suite CLI:** 
  - For easy project scaffolding task automation and workflow management.
  - Install `suite`: check the installation guidelines below.
- **Node.js:** 
  - As the runtime environment for executing the application code.  
  - 👉 [Download LTS version here](https://nodejs.org/en/download)
- At the project <service_root> create `.env`, `.env.dev` and `.env.staging` files and copy `environment variables` from the `.env.example` file

## Running Components

- A `component` in our `suite` jargon refers to a `service` or `application`. With `@microservices-suite` you can create 1 or more services as well as applications.
- Suite is `component-scoped`, giour strategy that enhances modularity and at the same time makes using the monorepo intuitive. Its is inspired by `Single Responsibility` principle.
- Apps are simply `cohessive` microservices `aggregated` under the `./gateway/apps/` directory to create decoupled services to serve your client. An example is an `Ecommerce app`. This app can have `customer, supplier,orders and products` microservices under the `./microservices/` directory. These microservices are then referenced in `docker-compose` file definitions placed under the `./gateway/apps/ecommerce-app/` directory. Other apps can be added to the `./gateway/apps` directory with their `docker-compose` definitions and `api-gateway configs(nginx/appache)`.
- Suite scales applications with `kubernetes` and app-scoped `k8s` configs are located under the `./k8s/` directory. Therefore the kubernetes configurations for our Ecommerce app will be located at `./k8s/ecommerce-app`
- [Suite CLI](https://github.com/microservices-suite/node-microservices-suite/tree/main/.suite-cli/cli) streamlines the process of starting a service(s) or app(s) in `development` & `production`. Follow these steps to get your environment up and running:
- You can derive the `service_name` or `app-name` from the workspace name found in the `package.json "name": ` property e.g 
```json
"name": "@microservices-suite/<component-name>"
```
- To run an app in either modes [dev,staging,prod]:
- If -k or --kubectl flag is specified `suite` spins your app with `kubectl` . You need to have [minikube](https://minikube.sigs.k8s.io/docs/start/) installed and [kubectl](https://kubernetes.io/docs/tasks/tools/). Otherwise defaults to docker compose
- If -m or --mode is specified you need to have a `docker-compose.<mode>` specified but this is not necessary with kubectl since we only run the development version of kubectl.
```bash
suite start [--kubectl,--mode]|[-km] <mode> <app-name...> 
```
- This command uses docker-compose to start your app(s)
- Suite will handle the setup, ensuring your app is ready.

### Running Services with -v --vanilla
- If you prefer not to use Docker, you can use the `-v,--vanilla`  command to start service(s) using node `PM2` engine in production or `nodemon` in any other mode:
```bash
suite start [--vanilla,--mode]|[-vm] <mode> <service_name...>
```

### Using Docker-Compose Directly
- Should you need to use docker-compose directly for more control over the container orchestration, you can utilize the standard commands provided by Docker:
- You can replace the yml files with your compose file path and production.yml has been used as an overide. There are many ways to kill the cat in dockers world 😎.
```bash
 docker-compose  -f docker-compose.yml -f production.yml up --build -d
 docker-compose down
```
